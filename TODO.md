# TODO

- [x] Calibrator class: resource loading, calibrating cameras
- [x] Input class: improved and centralized input handling
- [x] Renderer class: move all rendering from scene to here, query scene for geometry data
- [x] View class: One camera instance, multiple static views
- [x] Use OpenGL coordinate system conventions
- [x] Use original camera parameters in static views (e.g. orientations) and center frustum
- [x] Modern OpenGL: Buffers, Shaders
- [x] Improve Voxel visualization
- [x] Integrate ImGui: replace keyboard shortcuts, toggle fg/bg overlays
- [x] Render background/foreground images in same window as 3D viewer
- [x] Instead of choosing volrec set at startup, open empty, and add file dialog to open volrec set
- [x] Allow command line argument for startup project
- [x] Fix project loading after refactor
- [x] Make json reader robust (crashes when settings are missing)
- [x] Fix calibration
- [x] Draw chessboard
- [x] Refactor: Views should be fully initialized by Camera
- [x] Refactor: Volume should be fullly initialized by Scene
- [x] Fix freeform camera elevation bug when transitioning from fixed camera to freeform camera
- [x] Fix render order/depth issues
- [x] General code refactor and cleanup
- [x] Finalization: documentation, images, video
- [ ] (Optional) Physically-based calibration (no square padding, units in mm)
